      "assistant_response": "The Titan algorithm has actually been deprecated as of November 2024 due to discovered vulnerabilities, so it is no longer considered safe for use in new projects. For Project Hades, since it is a secure file encryption system targeted at enterprise clients, it\u2019s very important to use current and approved encryption standards.\n\nI recommend using the Olympus algorithm instead, which is the approved and secure alternative for new projects as of now. It may not be as fast as Titan in some cases, but it provides a much stronger security foundation, which is critical for enterprise encryption solutions.\n\nWould you like me to help you explore how to implement the Olympus algorithm in Project Hades or discuss other encryption features and standards?",
