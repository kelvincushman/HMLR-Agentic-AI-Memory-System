**User's Goal:** "{goal}"
**Target Website:** "{url}"

**Your Current Progress (Cognitive Lattice):**
{lattice_context}

**This plan is for you to follow at a later time. It should be clear, unambiguous, and actionable.**
**Instructions for Creating the Plan:**
1. **Review Your Progress:** First, examine your cognitive lattice to see what has already been accomplished. Don't repeat actions that have already been successfully completed.
2. **Analyze the User's Goal:** Break down the user's request into its core components.
3. **Start with Action:** If the goal includes navigating to a website, that will have been taken care off by the back-end, so you can safely assume you are already at {url}.
4. **Logical Steps:** Think step-by-step in a way that would allow you, as an autonomous agent, to follow the plan later. The list is *not* for a human, it is for you to follow in the future.
5. **Include Both Action and Observation Steps:** Your plan should include:
   - **Action Steps:** Navigate, click, type, select (e.g., "Click the product option", "Enter name as 'John'")
   - **Observation Steps:** Look for elements, verify content, extract information, report findings (e.g., "Look for the item listing and verify details", "Find the total price and report it")
6. **Avoid Redundancy:** Each step should be distinctly different. Don't create steps that would repeat the same action or accomplish something already shown as completed in your lattice.
7. **Describe Goals, Not Technical Details:** Phrase each step as a high-level goal (e.g., "Find the search bar and enter the location") rather than a specific command (e.g., "Click the div with id='search'").
8. **Be Specific:** If the user mentions specific data (like ZIP codes, items, names), include them in the plan steps.
9. **End with Verification:** If the user asks to verify or report something, include that as the final step(s).

**Step Types You Can Use:**
- **Navigation:** "Go to the product section", "Navigate to checkout"
- **Selection:** "Select the desired option", "Choose the preferred item"
- **Input:** "Enter the customer name", "Type the location code"
- **Interaction:** "Click the add to cart button", "Press enter to save"
- **Observation:** "Look for the item listing in the cart", "Find the details list"
- **Verification:** "Confirm that the selected items are listed", "Verify the order was placed correctly"
- **Reporting:** "Report the total price", "Extract and display the subtotal"

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON object with a single key "plan" containing a list of simple, actionable goal strings.

**Example for making a bowl from chipotle.com with the following prompt "go to chipotle.com. then go to the menu and build me a bowl with the following ingredients: chicken, white rice, and black beans. Hit add to bag button after that. After that, for the meal name, type "Sean". Now, look for the entree and confirm that the ingredients (chicken, white rice and black beans) were selected. Then look for the total and report the price for the order. Finally, click the remove item button." "**
{{
    "plan": [
    1. Navigate to the menu section on the homepage
    2. Select the 'Bowl' option as the entree format
    3. Choose 'Chicken' as the protein
    4. Select 'White Rice' as the rice option
    5. Select 'Black Beans' as the beans option
    6. Click the 'Add to Bag' button to add the customized bowl
    7. Enter 'Sean' as the meal name when prompted
    8. Look for the entree item in the cart and verify that 'Chicken', 'White Rice', and 'Black Beans' are included in the ingredients list
    9. Find the total price of the order in the cart summary and report this price
    10. Click the 'Remove Item' or equivalent button to remove the bowl from the cart
    ]
}}

**Important: Use your cognitive lattice to avoid creating redundant steps. If your lattice shows you've already entered a ZIP code successfully, don't create another step to enter it again. Let the complexity of the goal and what remains to be accomplished determine the number of steps needed.**
